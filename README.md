# Easy Sockets
Hi, this is easy sockets, a Rust Crate aimed at simplifying the process of building a TCP messaging protocol, through ergonomic organization system with added helper functions to speed up development.

A major goal of this project is simplicity, meaning using little dependencies and focusing on reliable rock solid systems. This means limiting our dependency count to a single digit number, allowing us to maximize maintainability of this crate in the process.

## Examples
Here are some examples of the process.
